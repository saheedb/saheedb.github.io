# HesGallery
Light, dependency free script creating a responsive gallery

## Instalation
Attach scripts to page
You can use a hosted version by hooking this script or import it locally by downloading a package of files, but remember to attach a CSS style sheet and disable the auto-hooking of styles in the options (more in *Global options* section).
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hes-gallery/dist/hes-gallery.min.js"></script>
```
When using CDN global object `HesGallery` will be registred

You can also install package by **npm** or **yarn**
```
$ npm i hes-gallery

$ yarn add hes-gallery
```

## How to use?
For each container with photos that you want to use as a gallery, give the class: (Each container is a singe, independent gallery)
```css
.hes-gallery
```

You can modify the options of the gallery using function described below

## Sample gallery design
```html
<div class="hes-gallery">
    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="image1" data-subtext="Subtext" />
    <img src="image2.jpg" alt="image2" data-subtext="Second subtext" />
    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="image3" data-subtext="Subtext" />
    <img src="image4.jpg" alt="image4" data-subtext="Subtext" />
</div>
```

## Global options
If you want, you can modify the gallery options to make it work better to you by using function `HesGallery.setOptions()`, you can also change settings passing settings object to `HesGallery.init()` function.  
Sample:
```javascript
HesGallery.setOptions({
    wrapAround: true,
    disableScrolling: true
})

HesGallery.init({
    wrapAround: true,
    disableScrolling: true
})
```
**Important**  
If you change the settings after initializing the script, not all options can be applied. To make sure that they will, use `HesGallery.init(options)` function.
